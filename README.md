# Wiki Generator
Creates consistently styled wikis for my games and projects.
## How To Use
It's mostly for my own personal use, but to use it:
- Clone the repo
- Don't touch literally anything other than the stuff in `definitions/`
- Deploy on GitHub Pages
- ???
- Profit
For the generator to work, the `index.html` file and everything in `generator/` must remain **untouched**.  
For help on syntax, see `help/.defs.md` and `help/info-box.md`.
